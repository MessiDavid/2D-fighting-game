make
` ` `

If you are using another development tool, manually create a project based on the tool's usage and add the game's source and header files to the project. Then add the include and bin directories to the header and library directories, respectively.

## Code reading

Header and source files are mainly encoded in UTF-8 and signed with a BOM. Make sure your code editor supports displaying text in UTF-8.

The source code is indented to a width of 8. Make sure you have your code editor indented to a width of 8 so that the code will appear in its proper format and be easy to read.

Change the font used in the code editor to a uniform width font so that the code displayed looks good.
